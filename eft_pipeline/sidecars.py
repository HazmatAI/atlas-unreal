"""Sidecar classification and per-consumer input ids, shared by the assembler and the build driver.

A .eftpack is assembled in one step but FINISHED by five more (SH bake, grass, gamedata, icons,
nav). Everything those later stages write lands in the live pack, so the atomic swap has to carry
them across a rebuild or every geometry change would throw away hours of bake time. That intent is
right. Carrying them SILENTLY is not: nav, volume and grass are all derived FROM the assembled
world, so after a rebuild they can describe a world the pack no longer contains.

WHY THE ID IS PER-CONSUMER AND NOT ONE "geometry id"

A single hash over the geometry blobs marks wrongly in both directions:

  * it OVER-marks. A decal-only rebuild changes meshes.bin, so nav.bin would be declared stale and
    a ~30-minute re-bake demanded for spray paint that nav does not even consume (nav_bake skips
    role="decal" faces).
  * it UNDER-marks. The SH volume is baked against the LIGHTS, which are not geometry at all. Re-aim
    every spot cone and a geometry hash does not move, so a genuinely stale volume.bin is carried
    forward and reported as current.

Marking wrongly in either direction is how a warning gets trained into background noise. So each
consumer gets an id over the inputs IT actually reads, and nothing else.
