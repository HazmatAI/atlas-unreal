"""decal_project - clip receiving geometry against a decal's projection box.

Unity's StaticDeferredDecal is a PROJECTOR: it paints whatever geometry lies inside its box, so a
sign spanning two staggered plates paints both. Emitting one flat quad at the box centre cannot do
that -- the nearer surface occludes the quad and the far half of the word vanishes (field report:
"the second part of Untar is missing ... its still behind the other metal plate").

These decals are STATIC by name, on static geometry, so the projection is evaluated ONCE here
instead of per-frame against a depth buffer: for every triangle inside the box, clip it to the box
and emit the clipped polygon with UVs taken from the box's own local X/Z. The pixels match what
Unity's deferred pass would produce, with no runtime cost and no renderer change.

Public entry: `project_decals(dataset, decals, log)` -> rewrites each decal instance in place to
reference a baked mesh, dropping decals whose box contains no geometry.
